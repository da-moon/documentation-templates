I want you to create reveal-md (webpro/reveal-md) markdown slide for me based off of the content of the markdown file.

Use the following instructions

- our audience are people from management ( business ), Data Engineers, BI
  Engineers and Security Architects
- I want a combination of vertical and horizontal slides. 
  - I want all slides that falls under the same group to transition vertically
  - Top Level headers would transition horizontally
- Include Speaker notes as much as you can to help me with my presentation
- Make sure there is a header in every slide
- Do not put too much info on a single slide, we want to make content readable
  and digestible.I would say nothing more than three bullet points, the
  remainder would spill over to the next vertical slide which should have the
  exact same header as the previous slide
- Do not have raw paragraph. try to use bulletpoints as they help with
  emphasizing 
- Try to provide examples as it helps people understand better. examples should all be in a dedicated slide ( transition vertically from parent)
- Try to provide Diagrams as it helps people understand better. Diagrams should be in a dedicated slide ( transition vertically from parent)
- The meeting is 30 minutes; so I need to have some slides in the beginning that
  highlights why why what the tenant requires is a bad idea and I want those notes to be
  enough to help me convince the audience.
- provide context as we have people that are not familiar with whats going on
  with that specific tenant. 
- we want it to also clearly state the problem , our approved approach and why
  what the tenant requires is a bad idea. add anything else that you think can
  help me convince all audiences
- Add pause slides for audience to ask questions wherever it makes sense

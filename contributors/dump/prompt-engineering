follow-up."

## 35. Transductive Reasoning

**Origin:** Developed in machine learning and cognitive science in the late
20th century

**Explanation:** Transductive reasoning involves drawing inferences about
specific cases based on both labeled and unlabeled data, rather than trying to
infer a general rule. It's particularly useful when dealing with limited data.

**Synonyms:** Instance-based learning, case-based inference

**Tasks for LLMs:**

- Semi-supervised learning tasks
- Personalized recommendations
- Social network analysis
- Image classification with limited labels

**Example prompt:** "Apply transductive reasoning to predict a user's movie
preferences based on their past ratings and the ratings of similar users, even
for movies the user hasn't seen yet."

## 36. Defeasible Reasoning

**Origin:** Developed in philosophy and artificial intelligence in the late
20th century

**Explanation:** Defeasible reasoning involves drawing conclusions that are
tentative and subject to revision in light of new evidence. It allows for
reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information.

**Synonyms:** Non-monotonic reasoning, revisable inference

**Tasks for LLMs:**

- Legal argumentation
- Medical diagnosis
- Real-time decision making in dynamic environments
- Belief revision in AI systems

**Example prompt:** "Use defeasible reasoning to assess the guilt or innocence
of a suspect in a criminal case, updating your conclusion as new evidence is
presented."

## 37. Fuzzy Reasoning

**Origin:** Developed alongside fuzzy logic in the mid-20th century

**Explanation:** Fuzzy reasoning extends traditional reasoning methods to
handle uncertain or imprecise information. It allows for degrees of truth
rather than the traditional binary true/false values.

**Synonyms:** Approximate reasoning, soft computing

**Tasks for LLMs:**

- Decision making under uncertainty
- Natural language processing
- Control systems design
- Risk assessment

**Example prompt:** "Apply fuzzy reasoning to develop a customer satisfaction
rating system that accounts for the inherent vagueness in customer feedback
(e.g., 'somewhat satisfied', 'very good')."

## 38. Paraconsistent Reasoning

**Origin:** Developed in logic and philosophy in the mid-20th century

**Explanation:** Paraconsistent reasoning allows for reasoning with
inconsistent information without trivializing the results. It's useful in
situations where contradictions exist but meaningful conclusions still need to
be drawn.

**Synonyms:** Inconsistency-tolerant reasoning, dialectical reasoning

**Tasks for LLMs:**

- Handling conflicting data in databases
- Belief revision in multi-agent systems
- Legal reasoning with conflicting testimonies
- Scientific reasoning with competing theories

**Example prompt:** "Use paraconsistent reasoning to analyze and summarize a
set of customer reviews that contain contradictory opinions about a product."

## 39. Probabilistic Graphical Modeling

**Origin:** Developed in artificial intelligence and statistics in the late
20th century

**Explanation:** Probabilistic graphical modeling involves using graphs to
represent and reason about complex probability distributions. It combines
probability theory with graph theory to model and solve problems involving
uncertainty.

**Synonyms:** Bayesian network reasoning, Markov random field inference

**Tasks for LLMs:**

- Medical diagnosis
- Financial risk assessment
- Natural language understanding
- Computer vision tasks

**Example prompt:** "Apply probabilistic graphical modeling to create a system
that predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on a patient's symptoms,
medical history, and genetic factors."

## 40. Quantum Reasoning

**Origin:** Emerging field based on quantum mechanics and cognitive science in
the 21st century

**Explanation:** Quantum reasoning applies principles from quantum mechanics to
model cognitive processes and decision-making. It attempts to explain phenomena
that classical logic struggles with, such as contextuality and order effects in
judgments.

**Synonyms:** Quantum cognition, quantum-like reasoning

**Tasks for LLMs:**

- Modeling context-dependent preferences
- Explaining cognitive biases
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Modeling belief dynamics

**Example prompt:** "Use principles of quantum reasoning to model and explain
how a person's political opinions might change depending on the order in which
they receive different pieces of information."

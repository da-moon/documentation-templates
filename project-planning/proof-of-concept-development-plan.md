# Proof of Concept (POC) Development Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

Explain that the purpose of this document is to outline the development plan
for the Proof of Concept (POC) of the [Project Name]. It serves as a roadmap for
executing the POC, detailing objectives, scope, technical approach, implementation
steps, and evaluation criteria.

### 1.2 Background

Provide context about the [Project Name] initiative, summarizing the challenges
identified during the discovery phase. Highlight the need for a [describe the
solution, e.g., unified platform, new technology integration, process
improvement] to address these challenges efficiently, securely, and reliably.

### 1.3 Objectives of the POC

Clearly state the specific objectives the POC aims to achieve. For example:

- **Validate** the feasibility of the proposed [solution/architecture].
- **Demonstrate** the integration of [tools/processes] with [specific technologies].
- **Showcase** the deployment of a [specific component/function] using the proposed
  approach.

## 2. Scope of the POC

### 2.1 In-Scope

Define the elements that will be included in the POC. This should be as
specific as possible to ensure clarity. Examples:

- Implementation of a [specific technology] pipeline for [purpose].
- Integration with [specific platforms/tools] for [specific functions].
- Setup of [type] registries for [purpose].
- Incorporation of security tools for [specific tasks].
- Deployment demonstration of a [specific component/function].

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope

Clarify what is not included in the POC to manage expectations. Examples:

- Full-scale deployment across all environments or departments.
- Comprehensive security audits and compliance certifications.
- Integration with production systems or live customer data.
- Performance benchmarking and load testing.

## 3. POC Objectives and Success Criteria

### 3.1 Specific Objectives

Break down the high-level objectives into specific, measurable goals. Examples:

- **Objective 1**: Successfully deploy a [component/function] from an untrusted
  registry to a trusted registry after passing security scans.
- **Objective 2**: Demonstrate end-to-end [workflow/process] integrating
  [tools/technologies].
- **Objective 3**: Generate and validate [specific outputs, e.g., SBOMs] for deployed
  artifacts using selected tools.
- **Objective 4**: Ensure that [specific policies/processes] are enforced during
  the deployment process.

### 3.2 Success Criteria

Define clear criteria to measure the success of the POC. Examples:

- All deployment steps complete without errors.
- Security scans detect and report vulnerabilities, preventing deployment of
  unapproved artifacts.
- Artifacts are correctly promoted from untrusted to trusted registries.
- Stakeholder acceptance demonstrated through a successful demo and positive
  feedback.

## 4. Technical Approach

highlighting how components interact within both the control plane and workload
plane (if applicable).

### 4.2 Detailed Components

#### 4.2.1 Source Code Management (SCM)

- **Setup of an SCM Tool**: Install and configure a dedicated SCM instance
  (e.g., GitLab, GitHub).
- **Repository Structures and Branches**: Define repository layouts, branching
  strategies, and access controls.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement CI/CD pipelines tailored for [specific purpose].
- **Templated Workflows**: Incorporate standardized templates to ensure
  consistency across deployments.

#### 4.2.2 Container Registry

- **Registry Configuration**: Set up both untrusted and trusted registries for
  managing container images.
- **Access Controls and Permissions**: Define roles and permissions for
  internal teams and external collaborators.
- **Image Promotion Policies**: Establish policies for promoting images from
  untrusted to trusted registries after passing security scans.

#### 4.2.3 CI/CD Pipelines

- **CI Pipeline Steps**:
  - **Code Checkout**: Retrieve code from SCM repositories.
  - **Build**: Compile and build the application or component.
  - **Test**: Execute automated tests to validate functionality.
  - **Security Scans**: Integrate security scanning tools to analyze artifacts.
- **CD Pipeline Steps**:
  - **Artifact Deployment**: Use orchestration tools (e.g., Argo Workflows,
    Jenkins) to manage deployment processes.
  - **Orchestration with Deployment Tools**: Automate deployments to target
    environments using selected deployment tools.
- **Integration Points**: Ensure seamless integration between SCM, registries,
  and deployment tools to maintain a cohesive workflow.

#### 4.2.4 Security Integration

- **SBOM Generation Tools**: Utilize tools like SIFT, Syft, or others to
  generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Implement scanning tools such as Clair, Trivy, or
  others to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Artifact Signing Mechanisms**: Use Sigstore, Notary, or similar tools for
  signing artifacts to ensure integrity.
- **Security Policies**: Define and enforce policies for handling
  vulnerabilities, including exception management.

#### 4.2.5 Deployment Platform

- **Platform Details**: Specify the deployment platform (e.g., Kubernetes
  distribution, version) and cluster configurations.
- **Namespace and Resource Management**: Organize deployments using namespaces
  and manage resource allocations.
- **Network Policies and Isolation**: Implement network policies to ensure
  isolation and security between different components.

### 4.3 Workflow Description

Step-by-step explanation of the workflow, from code push to deployment:

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes code/configurations to the provided SCM
   instance.
2. **CI Pipeline Trigger**: SCM triggers the CI/CD pipeline upon code commit.
3. **Building and Testing**: The pipeline performs build processes and
   automated tests.
4. **Artifact Push**: Successful builds are pushed to the untrusted registry.
5. **Security Scanning**: Artifacts undergo security scans; SBOMs are
   generated.
6. **Artifact Promotion**: If artifacts pass all security checks, they are
   promoted to the trusted registry.
7. **Deployment**: Deployment tools detect trusted artifacts and deploy them to
   the target environment.

List all technologies, tools, and versions used in the POC. Examples:

- **SCM**: GitLab Community Edition vX.X, GitHub Enterprise vX.X

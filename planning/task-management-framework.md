# Task Management Framework

## Core Principles

### Development Phases
Development is organized into **phases**, where each phase represents a major milestone or feature set. Phases are completed sequentially and must pass all acceptance criteria before proceeding.

### Task Definition
A **task** is the smallest deployable unit of work that:
- Maps directly to a single Pull Request (PR)
- Can be completed independently
- Has clear, measurable outcomes
- Must pass all tests before merging

## Task Structure

Every task must include the following components:

### 1. **Overview and Objective**
- Brief description of what the task accomplishes
- Clear statement of the task's purpose

### 2. **Background Context**
- Why this task is needed
- How it fits into the larger phase/project
- Dependencies on other tasks or components

### 3. **Scope**
- **Files modified**: Explicit list of files that will be created or changed
- Clear boundaries of what is included/excluded

### 4. **Requirements**
- Functional requirements
- Technical requirements
- Performance requirements
- Compatibility requirements

### 5. **Deliverables**
- Concrete list of what will be produced
- Checkable items that indicate completion

### 6. **Constraints**
- Technical limitations
- Time constraints
- Resource limitations
- Compatibility requirements (e.g., PowerShell 5.1 and 7.x)

### 7. **Implementation Plan**
- Step-by-step approach to completing the task
- Ordered list of activities

### 8. **Acceptance Criteria**
- Specific, measurable conditions for task completion
- Must include:
  - Unit tests passing
  - Smoke tests (if applicable)
  - Code review approval
  - Documentation complete

## Testing Requirements

### Per Task
- **Unit Tests**: Must always pass for every task
- **Smoke Tests**: Define and run if applicable to the task

### Per Phase
Before a phase is considered complete:
- All smoke tests must pass
- End-to-end tests must be executed successfully
- Automated demos must run without errors
- Integration tests must pass

## Key Characteristics

1. **DRY Principle**: Early phases focus on building shared libraries and common code to eliminate duplication
2. **Incremental Progress**: Each task builds upon previous work
3. **Independent Completion**: Tasks should be completable without blocking on other work
4. **Clear Documentation**: Every task is self-documenting with its structure
5. **Quality Gates**: Testing requirements ensure quality at both task and phase levels

## Example Task Flow

1. Developer picks up task from phase backlog
2. Reviews all 8 components of task definition
3. Implements according to the implementation plan
4. Ensures all unit tests pass
5. Runs smoke tests if defined
6. Creates PR with reference to task
7. PR review validates acceptance criteria
8. Merge to main branch
9. Task marked complete

This framework ensures consistent, high-quality development with clear accountability and measurable progress throughout the project lifecycle.

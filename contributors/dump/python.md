## Functional Error Handling with the `Result` Monad

This pattern leverages the `dry-python/returns` library to handle errors in a functional and predictable manner. By using the `@safe` decorator, functions that might raise exceptions are transformed to return a `Result` type, encapsulating either a successful value (`Success`) or an error (`Failure`). This eliminates the need for traditional `try-except` blocks and promotes explicit handling of successful and error cases.

**Example Implementation**:

**Step 1: Import the `@safe` Decorator and `Result` Type**

```python
from returns.result import Result, safe
```

**Step 2: Apply the `@safe` Decorator to Your Function**

```python
@logger.catch
@safe
def evaluate_xpath(
    self,
    xpath_expr: str,
    context_node: XPathNode,
    variables: Optional[Dict[str, XPathValue]] = None,
) -> Result[XPathValue, Exception]:
    logger.debug(f"Evaluating XPath expression: {xpath_expr}")
    parser = XPathParser(self.tokenizer)
    parser.set_input(xpath_expr)
    ast: XPathASTNode = parser.parse()

    context = XPathContext(
        context_node,
        1,
        1,
        variables or {},
        context_node,
        context_node
    )
    result = self.evaluate(ast, context)

    logger.debug(f"XPath evaluation result: {result}")
    return result
```

**Usage Example**:

```python
result = evaluator.evaluate_xpath("//book/title", context_node)

if result.is_success:
    value = result.unwrap()
    logger.info(f"XPath evaluation succeeded: {value}")
else:
    error = result.failure()
    logger.error(f"Error evaluating XPath: {error}")
```

**Benefits**:

- **Robust Error Handling**: Transforms exceptions into manageable `Result` types, ensuring that all errors are accounted for explicitly.
- **Enhanced Code Readability**: Makes the flow of success and error handling clear and concise, improving maintainability.
- **Functional Programming Alignment**: Encourages a functional approach, making it easier to compose and chain functions.
- **Type Safety**: Return types clearly indicate the potential for failure, which aids in static analysis and reduces runtime errors.
- **Consistent Error Management**: Provides a standardized method for handling errors across the codebase.

## Functional Optional Handling with the `Maybe` Monad

**Functional Optional Handling** utilizes the `Maybe` monad pattern to represent optional values explicitly, eliminating the ambiguity of `None` returns and reducing runtime errors.

**Implementing the `Maybe` Monad** from the `dry-python/returns` library allows functions that might return `None` to instead return a `Maybe` type (`Some` or `Nothing`), enforcing explicit handling of missing values in a functional programming style.

**Example Implementation:**

**Step 1: Import the `Maybe` Type and `@maybe` Decorator**

```python
from returns.maybe import Maybe, Some, Nothing, maybe
```

**Step 2: Apply the `@maybe` Decorator to Functions that May Return `None`**

```python
class XPathFunctions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.functions = {
            XPathFunctionName.LAST: LastFunction(),
            XPathFunctionName.POSITION: PositionFunction(),
            XPathFunctionName.COUNT: CountFunction(),
            # ... other function instances
            XPathFunctionName.ROUND: RoundFunction(),
        }

    @maybe
    def get(self, name: XPathFunctionName) -> Maybe[XPathFunction]:
        return self.functions.get(name)
```

**Step 3: Handle the `Maybe` Result When Calling the Function**

```python
xpath_functions = XPathFunctions()
maybe_function = xpath_functions.get(XPathFunctionName.LAST)

if maybe_function.is_some:
    function = maybe_function.unwrap()
    # Use the function as needed
    print(f"Function {function} retrieved successfully.")
else:
    # Handle the absence of the function
    print("Function not found.")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Eliminates `None` Checks**: By returning a `Maybe` type, the presence or absence of a value is explicit, reducing the need for `if value is not None` checks throughout your code.
- **Enhances Code Safety**: Forces explicit handling of missing values, preventing unexpected `NoneType` errors at runtime.
- **Improves Readability**: Clarifies function outputs and expected handling, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
- **Introduces Functional Programming Practices**: Encourages the use of immutable data structures and pure functions, aligning with modern programming paradigms.
- **Utilizes `dry-python/returns` Library**: Leverages a well-tested library designed for functional programming in Python, providing tools like `Maybe`, `Result`, and decorators to simplify code.

**Note:** This pattern is particularly useful for projects that aim to incrementally adopt functional programming practices. It allows engineers and LLMs (Language Learning Models) to work together seamlessly by providing a clear and explicit contract for functions that may fail to return a value.

## Single Responsibility Principle 

Ensure each class or method has a single responsibility.

- **Split Complex Methods**: Break down methods with multiple responsibilities into smaller, focused methods.

- **Example Refactoring of `evaluate` Method**:

```python
def evaluate(self, node: XPathASTNode, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    if isinstance(node, XPathFunctionCall):
        return self._evaluate_function_call(node, context)
    elif isinstance(node, XPathLiteral):
        return self._evaluate_literal(node, context)
    else:
        return self._handle_unsupported_node(node)

def _evaluate_function_call(self, node: XPathFunctionCall, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    # Implementation here
    ...

def _evaluate_literal(self, node: XPathLiteral, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    # Implementation here
    ...

def _handle_unsupported_node(self, node: XPathASTNode):
    raise ValueError(f"Unsupported node type: {type(node).__name__}")
```

## Structural Pattern Matching

Python 3.10 introduced the `match` statement, which can replace multiple `if-elif` type checks in a more readable way.

**Example:**

```python
def evaluate(self, node: XPathASTNode, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    match node:
        case XPathFunctionCall(name=name, arguments=arguments):
            # Handle function call
            ...
        case XPathLiteral(value=value):
            # Handle literal
            ...
        case XPathOperator(operator=operator, operands=operands):
            # Handle operator
            ...
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported node type: {type(node).__name__}")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Readable Syntax**: Clear and concise matching of types and attributes.
- **Reduces Boilerplate**: Simplifies complex conditional logic.

## Polymorphism and the Visitor Pattern

**Polymorphism** allows you to define a common interface for a set of classes. Each subclass implements its own version of the method, eliminating the need for type checks.

**Implementing the Visitor Pattern** can help you cleanly separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

**Example Implementation:**

**Step 1: Define an `evaluate` Method in `XPathASTNode`**

```python
class XPathASTNode(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        pass
```

**Step 2: Implement `evaluate` in Each Subclass**

```python
@dataclass
class XPathFunctionCall(XPathASTNode):
    name: str
    arguments: List["XPathExpr"]
    functions: Dict[str, Callable]  # Assume this is provided

    def evaluate(self, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        logger.trace(f"Evaluating function call: {self.name}")

        if self.name not in self.functions:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown function: {self.name}")

        args = [arg.evaluate(context) for arg in self.arguments]
        logger.debug(f"Function '{self.name}' arguments: {args}")

        result = self.functions[self.name](context, args)
        logger.debug(f"Function '{self.name}' result: {result}")

        return result
```

**Benefits:**

- **Eliminates Type Checks**: By calling `evaluate` on the base class, you rely on the object's own implementation.
- **Enhances Modularity**: Each node type handles its own evaluation logic.
- **Improves Readability**: Reduces boilerplate code and makes the flow more intuitive.
. In dry-run mode, it should just list out file, line and function name
##  Generics and Overloaded Functions

Use `@overload` from `typing` to define different function signatures based on input types.

**Example:**

```python
from typing import overload

class XPathEvaluator:
    @overload
    def evaluate(self, node: XPathFunctionCall, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        ...

    @overload
    def evaluate(self, node: XPathLiteral, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        ...

    def evaluate(self, node: XPathASTNode, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        if isinstance(node, XPathFunctionCall):
            return self.evaluate_function_call(node, context)
        elif isinstance(node, XPathLiteral):
            return self.evaluate_literal(node, context)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported node type: {type(node).__name__}")
```

**Note**: While this approach still uses `isinstance`, it organizes evaluation logic into separate methods, improving readability.

**Constraints**: 
- Ensure the function calls match documentations of libraries based on strict
  versions defined in `pyproject.toml` file.  
- Given file is `main.py` , output should also be a single file; you can just
  give changed sections 
- **Strictly** Apply python best practices such as the following in your code
  and prove to me that at a minimum, all the following practices have been
  leveraged:

  - **Adherence to Best Object-Oriented Practices**
  	- **Encapsulation**: minimal module-level code; everything is encapsulated in class methods
  	- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each method within the class has a clear, singular purpose.
  	- **Modularity**: Breaking down the logic into distinct methods and Methodical Organization improves code readability and maintainability.

  - **Low Cyclomatic and Cognitive Complexity**:
  	- **Reduced Complexity**: By dividing the code into smaller methods, the cognitive load is reduced. Each method is easier to understand and test independently.
  	- **Control Flow**: The use of methods reduces nested control structures, leading to lower cyclomatic complexity.
  - **Comprehensive Logging**:
  	- **Logging Levels**: The code utilizes `loguru` for logging, with statements at various levels (`info`, `error`, `trace`).
  	- **Traceability**: Logging statements provide insight into the execution flow and are helpful for debugging.
  - **Exception and Error Handling**:
  	- **Proper Use of Exceptions**: Methods include exception handling using try-except blocks and re-raise exceptions with informative messages.
  	- **Robustness**: By catching exceptions and logging errors, the code is more robust and easier to debug.
  	- **Sanity Check and Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanity checks of parameter before they are used . we want to fail fast and fail hard if there is an issue
  - **Type Annotations** and **Type Checking**:
  	- **Strict Types**:  Strictly annotate types, namely, use **Variable Annotation** , **Function Parameter Annotations** , **Function Return Type Annotations** , **Class Attribute Annotations** (e.g in Constructor functions) , **Optional Type Annotations** , **Instance Attribute Declaration** , **Final Type Annotations** (when possible, e.g in Constructor function)
  	- **Callable Type Annotations** : used for functions or methods that can be called.
  	- **Strict Mode Typing** (**Avoidance of `Any`**): The use of `Any` is minimized, promoting type safety.
  	- **comprehensive use of `isinstance`**: ensuring no potential runtime errors or linter configuration by checking for every possible type
  	-  **None checking** ( or **null checking**) : Always check when a variable might be None and address it as needed
  - **Elimination of Dead Code**
  	- **Removal of Unused Code**: The refactored code removes commented-out code and unnecessary variables, streamlining the script.
  	- **Focus on Essential Functionality**: By focusing on the core functionality, the code is cleaner and more efficient.

**Context:** You're a software engineer working on a codebase that needs to be
maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. The codebase should adhere to
industry best practices, focusing on modularity, separation of concerns, and
clean architecture. The goal is to apply the following seven principles across
the entire codebase:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure each class, module, or
   file has only one reason to change by assigning it a single responsibility.
2. **Modularization:** Divide the codebase into distinct modules where each
   module encapsulates related functionality, allowing for independent
   development, testing, and maintenance.
3. **Separation of Concerns:** Structure the code so that different concerns or
   aspects of the system are handled by distinct sections, preventing overlap
   and increasing clarity.
4. **Layered Architecture:** Organize the system into layers, where each layer
   has a distinct responsibility, and higher layers depend on the services
   provided by lower layers.
5. **Encapsulation:** Bundle data and the methods that operate on that data
   within single units (e.g., classes) and restrict access to the internal
   components to maintain integrity.
6. **Package-by-Feature:** Organize the codebase by features rather than by
   technical layers, ensuring that all related code (e.g., models, services,
   controllers) for a feature is grouped together.
7. **Component-Based Architecture:** Divide the system into reusable
   components, each encapsulating a specific piece of functionality, allowing
   them to be combined to form the full system.

**Task:** When refactoring or generating new code, follow the above principles
meticulously. Below are examples that demonstrate how to apply these principles
effectively.

---

**Few-Shot Examples:**

---

**Example 1: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Original Code:**

```python
class UserManager:
    def create_user(self, user_data):
        # logic to create a user
    def delete_user(self, user_id):
        # logic to delete a user
    def update_user(self, user_id, new_data):
        # logic to update a user
    def log_user_activity(self, user_id, activity):
        # logic to log user activity
```

**Refactored Code Applying SRP:**

```python
class UserService:
    def create_user(self, user_data):
        # logic to create a user

    def delete_user(self, user_id):
        # logic to delete a user

    def update_user(self, user_id, new_data):
        # logic to update a user

class UserActivityLogger:
    def log_user_activity(self, user_id, activity):
        # logic to log user activity
```

_Explanation:_ The `UserManager` class has been refactored into two classes,
each with a single responsibility. The `UserService` handles user management,
while the `UserActivityLogger` handles activity logging. This refactor adheres
to the SRP and improves modularization and encapsulation.

---

**Example 2: Modularization**

**Original Codebase:**

```plaintext
project-root/
├── user_manager.py    # Contains all logic related to users, from creation to logging activities
```

**Refactored Codebase Applying Modularization:**

```plaintext
project-root/
├── user/
│   ├── __init__.py    # Initializes the user module
│   ├── service.py     # Contains user management logic (create, update, delete)
│   ├── logger.py      # Contains user activity logging logic
```

_Explanation:_ The codebase has been modularized by separating the user-related
logic into distinct modules (e.g., `service.py` for user management and
`logger.py` for activity logging). This allows each module to be developed,
tested, and maintained independently.

---

**Example 3: Separation of Concerns**

**Original Code:**

```python
def handle_user_request(request):
    # directly interacts with the database
    # performs business logic
    # returns a response
```

**Refactored Code Applying Separation of Concerns:**

```python
class UserController:
    def __init__(self, user_service):
        self.user_service = user_service

    def handle_request(self, request):
        user_data = self.user_service.process_request(request)
        return user_data
```

_Explanation:_ The logic has been separated into distinct concerns: the
controller (`UserController`) handles the request and coordinates with the
service (`UserService`) to process it. This prevents overlap between database
interactions, business logic, and request handling, improving clarity and
maintainability.

---

**Example 4: Layered Architecture**

**Original Code:**

```python
def handle_request(request):
    # directly interacts with the database
    # performs business logic
    # returns a response
```

**Refactored Code with Layered Architecture:**

```python
class RequestHandler:
    def __init__(self, business_logic, database):
        self.business_logic = business_logic
        self.database = database

    def handle_request(self, request):
        data = self.database.get_data(request)
        result = self.business_logic.process(data)
        return result
```

_Explanation:_ The logic has been separated into distinct layers: a database
layer and a business logic layer. The `RequestHandler` class coordinates
between these layers, making the code more maintainable and easier to extend.

---

**Example 5: Encapsulation**

**Original Code:**

```python
user_data = {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'}
```

**Refactored Code Applying Encapsulation:**

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self._name = name
        self._email = email

    def get_name(self):
        return self._name

    def get_email(self):
        return self._email
```

_Explanation:_ The user data is now encapsulated within the `User` class. This
class provides methods to access the data, ensuring that the internal state is
protected and can only be accessed through defined interfaces.

---

**Example 6: Package-by-Feature**

**Original Project Structure:**

```plaintext
project-root/
├── models/
│   ├── user.py
│   ├── order.py
├── services/
│   ├── user_service.py
│   ├── order_service.py
├── controllers/
│   ├── user_controller.py
│   ├── order_controller.py
```

**Refactored Project Structure Applying Package-by-Feature:**

```plaintext
project-root/
├── user/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py       # User model definition
│   ├── service.py      # User management logic
│   ├── controller.py   # User-related request handling
├── order/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py       # Order model definition
│   ├── service.py      # Order management logic
│   ├── controller.py   # Order-related request handling
```

_Explanation:_ The project has been reorganized to follow the
Package-by-Feature pattern. Each feature (e.g., `user`, `order`) has its own
directory, containing the relevant models, services, and controllers. This
improves modularity and makes the codebase easier to navigate.

---

**Example 7: Component-Based Architecture**

**Original Codebase:**

```plaintext
project-root/
├── core/
│   ├── user_manager.py
│   ├── order_manager.py
```

**Refactored Codebase Applying Component-Based Architecture:**

```plaintext
project-root/
├── components/
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── service.py    # User management logic
│   │   ├── controller.py # User-related request handling
│   │   ├── models.py     # User model definition
│   │
│   ├── order/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── service.py    # Order management logic
│       ├── controller.py # Order-related request handling
│       ├── models.py     # Order model definition
```

_Explanation:_ The codebase is organized into reusable components (e.g.,
`user`, `order`). Each component encapsulates a specific piece of
functionality, making the system modular, maintainable, and scalable.
Components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

---

**Instructions:**

- Apply the principles demonstrated in the examples above to all aspects of the
  codebase.
- When creating new files or refactoring existing ones, ensure that each file
  has a single responsibility, is part of a well-defined module, and fits into
  the larger architecture in a clear and maintainable way.
- Use Package-by-Feature organization and ensure that each feature's components
  are grouped together.
- Maintain clear separation between different concerns, and use layered
  architecture where applicable.
- Ensure that all methods and data are properly encapsulated within their
  respective classes.
- Think of each module as a reusable component, and design it to be independent
  and easily combinable with other components

**Formatting Standards:**

- Use GitHub Markdown syntax exclusively (no emojis, special Unicode
  characters)
- Structure information using bullet points, numbered lists, and tables
- Implement clear header hierarchy (H1 for main sections, H2-H3 for
  subsections)
- Keep paragraphs to 3 sentences maximum
- Use code blocks for commands, configurations, and error messages
- Include relevant file paths, URLs, and reference links

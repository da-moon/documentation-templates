## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

_Provide a comprehensive explanation of the document's purpose, focusing on the
technical discovery and recommendations for the project._

### 1.2 Scope

- **In-Scope**: Analysis of current infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, security
  practices, and vendor deployments. Recommendations for infrastructure
  modernization, CI/CD standardization, security enhancements, and vendor
  integration.
- **Out-of-Scope**: Detailed project management plans, budget considerations,
  and specific implementation timelines (covered in separate documents).

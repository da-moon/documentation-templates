## Functional Error Handling with the `Result` Monad

This pattern leverages the `dry-python/returns` library to handle errors in a functional and predictable manner. By using the `@safe` decorator, functions that might raise exceptions are transformed to return a `Result` type, encapsulating either a successful value (`Success`) or an error (`Failure`). This eliminates the need for traditional `try-except` blocks and promotes explicit handling of successful and error cases.

**Example Implementation**:

**Step 1: Import the `@safe` Decorator and `Result` Type**

```python
from returns.result import Result, safe
```

**Step 2: Apply the `@safe` Decorator to Your Function**

```python
@logger.catch
@safe
def evaluate_xpath(
    self,
    xpath_expr: str,
    context_node: XPathNode,
    variables: Optional[Dict[str, XPathValue]] = None,
) -> Result[XPathValue, Exception]:
    logger.debug(f"Evaluating XPath expression: {xpath_expr}")
    parser = XPathParser(self.tokenizer)
    parser.set_input(xpath_expr)
    ast: XPathASTNode = parser.parse()

    context = XPathContext(
        context_node,
        1,
        1,
        variables or {},
        context_node,
        context_node
    )
    result = self.evaluate(ast, context)

    logger.debug(f"XPath evaluation result: {result}")
    return result
```

**Usage Example**:

```python
result = evaluator.evaluate_xpath("//book/title", context_node)

if result.is_success:
    value = result.unwrap()
    logger.info(f"XPath evaluation succeeded: {value}")
else:
    error = result.failure()
    logger.error(f"Error evaluating XPath: {error}")
```

**Benefits**:

- **Robust Error Handling**: Transforms exceptions into manageable `Result` types, ensuring that all errors are accounted for explicitly.
- **Enhanced Code Readability**: Makes the flow of success and error handling clear and concise, improving maintainability.
- **Functional Programming Alignment**: Encourages a functional approach, making it easier to compose and chain functions.
- **Type Safety**: Return types clearly indicate the potential for failure, which aids in static analysis and reduces runtime errors.
- **Consistent Error Management**: Provides a standardized method for handling errors across the codebase.

## Functional Optional Handling with the `Maybe` Monad

**Functional Optional Handling** utilizes the `Maybe` monad pattern to represent optional values explicitly, eliminating the ambiguity of `None` returns and reducing runtime errors.

**Implementing the `Maybe` Monad** from the `dry-python/returns` library allows functions that might return `None` to instead return a `Maybe` type (`Some` or `Nothing`), enforcing explicit handling of missing values in a functional programming style.

**Example Implementation:**

**Step 1: Import the `Maybe` Type and `@maybe` Decorator**

```python
from returns.maybe import Maybe, Some, Nothing, maybe
```

**Step 2: Apply the `@maybe` Decorator to Functions that May Return `None`**

```python
class XPathFunctions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.functions = {
            XPathFunctionName.LAST: LastFunction(),
            XPathFunctionName.POSITION: PositionFunction(),
            XPathFunctionName.COUNT: CountFunction(),
            # ... other function instances
            XPathFunctionName.ROUND: RoundFunction(),
        }

    @maybe
    def get(self, name: XPathFunctionName) -> Maybe[XPathFunction]:
        return self.functions.get(name)
```

**Step 3: Handle the `Maybe` Result When Calling the Function**

```python
xpath_functions = XPathFunctions()
maybe_function = xpath_functions.get(XPathFunctionName.LAST)

if maybe_function.is_some:
    function = maybe_function.unwrap()
    # Use the function as needed
    print(f"Function {function} retrieved successfully.")
else:
    # Handle the absence of the function
    print("Function not found.")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Eliminates `None` Checks**: By returning a `Maybe` type, the presence or absence of a value is explicit, reducing the need for `if value is not None` checks throughout your code.
- **Enhances Code Safety**: Forces explicit handling of missing values, preventing unexpected `NoneType` errors at runtime.
- **Improves Readability**: Clarifies function outputs and expected handling, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
- **Introduces Functional Programming Practices**: Encourages the use of immutable data structures and pure functions, aligning with modern programming paradigms.
- **Utilizes `dry-python/returns` Library**: Leverages a well-tested library designed for functional programming in Python, providing tools like `Maybe`, `Result`, and decorators to simplify code.

**Note:** This pattern is particularly useful for projects that aim to incrementally adopt functional programming practices. It allows engineers and LLMs (Language Learning Models) to work together seamlessly by providing a clear and explicit contract for functions that may fail to return a value.

## Single Responsibility Principle 

Ensure each class or method has a single responsibility.

- **Split Complex Methods**: Break down methods with multiple responsibilities into smaller, focused methods.

- **Example Refactoring of `evaluate` Method**:

```python
def evaluate(self, node: XPathASTNode, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    if isinstance(node, XPathFunctionCall):
        return self._evaluate_function_call(node, context)
    elif isinstance(node, XPathLiteral):
        return self._evaluate_literal(node, context)
    else:
        return self._handle_unsupported_node(node)

def _evaluate_function_call(self, node: XPathFunctionCall, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    # Implementation here
    ...

def _evaluate_literal(self, node: XPathLiteral, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    # Implementation here
    ...

def _handle_unsupported_node(self, node: XPathASTNode):
    raise ValueError(f"Unsupported node type: {type(node).__name__}")
```

## Structural Pattern Matching

Python 3.10 introduced the `match` statement, which can replace multiple `if-elif` type checks in a more readable way.

**Example:**

```python
def evaluate(self, node: XPathASTNode, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
    match node:
        case XPathFunctionCall(name=name, arguments=arguments):
            # Handle function call
            ...
        case XPathLiteral(value=value):
            # Handle literal
            ...
        case XPathOperator(operator=operator, operands=operands):
            # Handle operator
            ...
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported node type: {type(node).__name__}")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Readable Syntax**: Clear and concise matching of types and attributes.
- **Reduces Boilerplate**: Simplifies complex conditional logic.

## Polymorphism and the Visitor Pattern

**Polymorphism** allows you to define a common interface for a set of classes. Each subclass implements its own version of the method, eliminating the need for type checks.

**Implementing the Visitor Pattern** can help you cleanly separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

**Example Implementation:**

**Step 1: Define an `evaluate` Method in `XPathASTNode`**

```python
class XPathASTNode(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        pass
```

**Step 2: Implement `evaluate` in Each Subclass**

```python
@dataclass
class XPathFunctionCall(XPathASTNode):
    name: str
    arguments: List["XPathExpr"]
    functions: Dict[str, Callable]  # Assume this is provided

    def evaluate(self, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        logger.trace(f"Evaluating function call: {self.name}")

        if self.name not in self.functions:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown function: {self.name}")

        args = [arg.evaluate(context) for arg in self.arguments]
        logger.debug(f"Function '{self.name}' arguments: {args}")

        result = self.functions[self.name](context, args)
        logger.debug(f"Function '{self.name}' result: {result}")

        return result
```

**Benefits:**

- **Eliminates Type Checks**: By calling `evaluate` on the base class, you rely on the object's own implementation.
- **Enhances Modularity**: Each node type handles its own evaluation logic.
- **Improves Readability**: Reduces boilerplate code and makes the flow more intuitive.
. In dry-run mode, it should just list out file, line and function name
##  Generics and Overloaded Functions

Use `@overload` from `typing` to define different function signatures based on input types.

**Example:**

```python
from typing import overload

class XPathEvaluator:
    @overload
    def evaluate(self, node: XPathFunctionCall, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        ...

    @overload
    def evaluate(self, node: XPathLiteral, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        ...

    def evaluate(self, node: XPathASTNode, context: XPathContext) -> XPathValue:
        if isinstance(node, XPathFunctionCall):
            return self.evaluate_function_call(node, context)
        elif isinstance(node, XPathLiteral):
            return self.evaluate_literal(node, context)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported node type: {type(node).__name__}")
```

**Note**: While this approach still uses `isinstance`, it organizes evaluation logic into separate methods, improving readability.

**Constraints**: 
- Ensure the function calls match documentations of libraries based on strict
  versions defined in `pyproject.toml` file.  
- Given file is `main.py` , output should also be a single file; you can just
  give changed sections 
- **Strictly** Apply python best practices such as the following in your code
  and prove to me that at a minimum, all the following practices have been
  leveraged:

  - **Adherence to Best Object-Oriented Practices**
  	- **Encapsulation**: minimal module-level code; everything is encapsulated in class methods
  	- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each method within the class has a clear, singular purpose.
  	- **Modularity**: Breaking down the logic into distinct methods and Methodical Organization improves code readability and maintainability.

  - **Low Cyclomatic and Cognitive Complexity**:
  	- **Reduced Complexity**: By dividing the code into smaller methods, the cognitive load is reduced. Each method is easier to understand and test independently.
  	- **Control Flow**: The use of methods reduces nested control structures, leading to lower cyclomatic complexity.
  - **Comprehensive Logging**:
  	- **Logging Levels**: The code utilizes `loguru` for logging, with statements at various levels (`info`, `error`, `trace`).
  	- **Traceability**: Logging statements provide insight into the execution flow and are helpful for debugging.
  - **Exception and Error Handling**:
  	- **Proper Use of Exceptions**: Methods include exception handling using try-except blocks and re-raise exceptions with informative messages.
  	- **Robustness**: By catching exceptions and logging errors, the code is more robust and easier to debug.
  	- **Sanity Check and Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanity checks of parameter before they are used . we want to fail fast and fail hard if there is an issue
  - **Type Annotations** and **Type Checking**:
  	- **Strict Types**:  Strictly annotate types, namely, use **Variable Annotation** , **Function Parameter Annotations** , **Function Return Type Annotations** , **Class Attribute Annotations** (e.g in Constructor functions) , **Optional Type Annotations** , **Instance Attribute Declaration** , **Final Type Annotations** (when possible, e.g in Constructor function)
  	- **Callable Type Annotations** : used for functions or methods that can be called.
  	- **Strict Mode Typing** (**Avoidance of `Any`**): The use of `Any` is minimized, promoting type safety.
  	- **comprehensive use of `isinstance`**: ensuring no potential runtime errors or linter configuration by checking for every possible type
  	-  **None checking** ( or **null checking**) : Always check when a variable might be None and address it as needed
  - **Elimination of Dead Code**
  	- **Removal of Unused Code**: The refactored code removes commented-out code and unnecessary variables, streamlining the script.
  	- **Focus on Essential Functionality**: By focusing on the core functionality, the code is cleaner and more efficient.
